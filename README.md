# A `tidytext` analysis of state ESSA plans

State ESSA plans [are available on the ED website](https://www2.ed.gov/admins/lead/account/stateplan17/statesubmission.html). This project downloads the pdf documents, scrapes the text, and processes the text using tools from the `tidytext` R package.


A recent post on EdWeek's Campaign K-12 blog [took a look at the edu-jargon in state ESSA plans]( http://blogs.edweek.org/edweek/campaign-k-12/2017/06/ESSA_plans_most_popular_education_jargon_.html).
